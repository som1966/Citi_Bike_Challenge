Bike sharing is where bicycles are made available for shared use to people on a short term basis.  It allows people to borrow a bike at a certain location and return it to another location.  It is an economical and convienient to use bikes for trips that are too far to walk and to short to drive.  Most programs offer annual subscriptions and short term users.  In NYC, annual subscribers make up 81% of the customer base.
